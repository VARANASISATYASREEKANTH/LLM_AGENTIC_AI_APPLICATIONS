Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and perception.
Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, which is a subfield of ML, uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in large amounts of data.
Applications of AI are widespread, ranging from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems on Netflix and Amazon, and even to medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles.
Ethical concerns in AI include job displacement, privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for transparent and explainable systems.
