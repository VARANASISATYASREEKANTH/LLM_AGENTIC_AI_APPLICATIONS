## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Agent-based design (SeatMatrixAgent, RequestAgent, AllocatorAgent)
- âœ… Group-aware seat allocation (tries to seat groups together)
- âœ… Visual representation of bus seat matrix using Matplotlib
- âœ… Easy to extend with preferences (window, aisle), cancellations, or real-time UI
